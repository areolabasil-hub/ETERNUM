    <h1>Chapter 1 — Genesis</h1>
    <div class="chapter-text">
      <p>The throne of hell was never meant for a human—except one.</p>
      <p>Betrayed by his kind. Forgotten by the Fortuna’s.</p>
      <p>He is hell-bent on revenge as his name fades from life itself.</p>
      <p>He is neither human nor Fortuna. He is something else.</p>
      <p>Every fibre of his body reshaping into the divine and damned.</p>
      <p>Slave. Thrall. General. Vizier.</p>
      <p>Each step soaked in lies and sharpened by deceit, till he claimed the throne himself.</p>
      <p>He was called the bringer of death. But no...this man was death’s vessel.</p>
      <p>Now, he wielded the chains of eternity.</p>
      <p>Hell’s fire bent to his will and even the undead dared not whisper his name.</p>
      <p>Glowing fire possesses his eyes, his face bathed in bitter satisfaction.</p>
      <p>His voice sent chills down the spine of hell at once.</p>
      <p><strong>“It is time”.</strong></p>
      <hr />
      <p>Far away from scorching hell…</p>
      <p>Beneath the sun still warm and sky still blue...</p>
      <p>A boy walks home from school—unaware of the journey and darkness that lies ahead.</p>
      <p>“I’m a year older—so I’m 17 now.”</p>
      <p>“Ohh, yeah. I gotta go see Mom at the hospital.”</p>
      <p>“I don’t think I’ve seen—”</p>
      <p><strong>WHACK</strong><br>A banana smacked him in the head.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been around school looking for your ass!” she says while heaving for breath and wiping the sweat from her brow.</p>
      <p>Darian hands her a napkin, secretly fascinated by her beauty.</p>
      <p>“Didn’t you hear me? Where you been?” she asked.</p>
      <p>“Ohh I’m sorry. I was at band practice.”<br>He looked away.</p>
      <p>“I was just thinking about you. I haven’t seen you in a while.”</p>
      <p>“Yeah me too. I’ve been occupied with basketball classes.”</p>
      <p>“What are you doing?” Darian asked, confused, as she dug through his bag.</p>
      <p>“There it is. I’m looking for your test results. Wanna compare them to mine.”<br>She sat down at the nearest bench, her voice serious.</p>
      <p>“You could’ve just asked,” he sighed in mock annoyance.</p>
      <p>“Somehow you always seem to beat me don’t ya?”<br>She smirked, eyes glinting with admiration.</p>
      <p>“You said you were looking for me. Why?”</p>
      <p>“Ohh, right. Gotcha something. Never understood your obsession with the guy, but here you go. Happy Birthday.”</p>
      <p>She hands him a piece of hard paper.</p>
      <p>Surprised, he took it gently.</p>
      <p>“You got me tickets...to the Death Note cosplay event?”</p>
      <p>“I thought they were sold out!” he said, smiling wide.</p>
      <p>She giggled. “My mom’s friends with the organiser. You’ll get to hang out with him the whole time.”</p>
      <p>“Thank you, Natsuki.”</p>
      <p>“I’m gonna be late, I’ve gotta go,” she said. They bid themselves goodbye.</p>
      <p>Arriving home, he noticed a wrapped present on the table—his father’s gift.</p>
      <p>He tore it open.</p>
      <p>Inside was a ring, silver, carved with the family crest.</p>
      <p>“A ring...with a Kamon?”</p>
      <p>He slid it onto his middle finger.</p>
      <p>Most of the day was blurred into reading, gaming, cake.</p>
      <p>All celebrated alone.</p>
      <p>And yet...he seemed content.</p>
      <p><strong>Clank.</strong></p>
      <p>The door goes behind him as he left for the hospital.</p>
      <p>The streets were busy as usual, but something felt off. A chill in the air.</p>
      <p>Cars hummed past. Parents called their kids into the house—warning them not to catch a cold.</p>
      <p>Digital billboards highlighting new generator inventions and gaming wars.</p>
      <p>“Why’s it cold? Even the ring’s freezing?” he says as he hides his hands in his sleeves.<br>“Never trust the weatherman I guess,” he says while shivering.</p>
      <p>Pauses. Opening the doors to the hospital with the smell of antiseptics attacking his throat.</p>
      <p>Glancing at the ring again it seemed tighter on his hand and heavier.<br>He ignores it.</p>
      <p>His mother still laying in bed, sheets pulled to her stomach.<br>Her breathing, shallow.</p>
      <p>His mother’s body. Life depleting.</p>
      <p>Holding the tears was the hardest thing he’s ever done.</p>
      <p>“Mom, how are you feeling?”<br>His voice cracked with concern.</p>
      <p>“Have you been taking your meds?”</p>
      <p><em>Silence</em></p>
      <p>“You’re still not gonna talk, huh?”</p>
      <p>He decides to speak for her—telling her stories of winning the online chess leagues, his grades, band practice.</p>
      <p>Until finally her voice broke through.</p>
      <p>“Do you...have any friends?”</p>
      <p>He froze.</p>
      <p>“...I have Natsuki,” he whispered.</p>
      <p>“She’s not your friend.”<br>Her eyes—hollow, pale—cut into him.</p>
      <p>“Why would anyone want to be around you?”</p>
      <p>He blinked. Confused.</p>
      <p>“What are you talking about...?”</p>
      <p>She turned away. Tears sliding down her cheeks.</p>
      <p>“I never wanted a child,” she said, eyes fixed on the ceiling. Her voice trembled.</p>
      <p>“I wanted my body. Beautiful. Like it was in my youth.”</p>
      <p>He stared down at his arms.</p>
      <p>“You came along and ruined it. I was a model. People loved me. Now, no one even knows who I am.”</p>
      <p>She sniffled.</p>
      <p>“You took it all from me. I regret ever having you.”<br>Her hands shot out, clutching his shirt trembling with rage.<br>“You were a mistake.”</p>
      <p><em>Silence.</em></p>
      <p>He wanted to scream but he couldn’t, like razors were at his neck.</p>
      <p>He always thought silence meant peace. But it feels like a punishment now.</p>
      <p>He didn’t move.</p>
      <p>He just handed her a cup of water.</p>
      <p>She slapped it away—hard.</p>
      <p><strong>CRASH</strong><br>The glass shatters mid-air.</p>
      <p>A shard slices into his palm.</p>
      <p>Blood dripped, slow, steady.</p>
      <p>He doesn’t cry or flinch.</p>
      <p>“Why did you do that?” his voice low, broken.</p>
      <p>“Get out,” his mother said.<br>“Get out!” she yelled.</p>
      <p><strong>Beep. Beep. Beep.</strong><br>The EKG ringed.</p>
      <p>“
